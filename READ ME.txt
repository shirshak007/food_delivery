Respected Sir,
	
Please follow these steps to use this software.

1. Please Start XAMPP or WAMP services & create a database named "food_delivery" without any password using phpmyadmin.

2. Please download the "hungrydigger.com.rar" file and extract it into "xampp/htdocs" for XAMPP or "wamp/www" for WAMP.

3. Inside the extracted folder there is another subfolder called "Tables". Import "food_delivery.sql" into created database using phpmyadmin.

4. Open any HTML5 supported(for better result) and write in address bar "localhost/hungrydigger.com" and use it.

** If there is any issue showing reports in bar graphs then please try an alternative browser.
** While accessing admin part of this software please use Admin ID:1 and Password:123

Thanking you,

Faithfully yours,
